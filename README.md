# 7kt-Plus
Hosts the recommended scripts and userstyle for my userstyle 7kt-Plus.

7kt-Plus is a userstyle that adds additional css for 7kttube (https://7kt.se/downloads/5/7kttube-2016-redux) to make it more accurate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7kt-Plus is not affialiated with the 7kttube or its creator 7kt-swe (https://github.com/7kt-swe) and all scripts hosted and css contributed to this userstyle belong to their respective owners.
